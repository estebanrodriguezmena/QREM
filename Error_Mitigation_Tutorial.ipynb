    "## Theoretical background\n",
    "Here we describe main theoretical concepts related to mitigation procedure. For more detailed description, see Ref. [0].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical noise model\n",
    "Let us denote by $\\mathbf{M}$ a POVM describing noisy detector and $\\mathbf{P}$ denote ideal measurement. In classical noise model, we assume that the relation between the two is given by stochastic, invertible map $\\Lambda$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{M} = \\Lambda \\mathbf{P}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us denote by $\\mathbf{p}_{exp}$ vector of probabilities obtained on a noisy detector $\\mathbf{M}$ measuring any quantum state, and by $\\mathbf{p_{ideal}}$ the analogous vector for ideal detector (for the same quantum state). From linearity of the Born's rule, it follows that two vectors are related by the same stochastic map as POVMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{p_{exp}} = \\Lambda \\mathbf{p_{ideal}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we assumed that $\\Lambda$ is invertible. Hence by multiplying last equation by $\\Lambda^{-1}$ from both sides, we obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{p_{exp}} = \\mathbf{p_{ideal}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, by this kind of postprocessing, we obtain statistics which we would have obtained on the perfect detector devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deviations from noise model\n",
    "#### Effects  on mitigation\n",
    "Above we assumed a very specific noise model. In practice it is likely that it will not be fulfilled exactly. In such a scenario, we may perform the following decomposition of POVM $M$ describing our device:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{M} = \\Lambda \\mathbf{P} + \\mathbf{\\Delta}\\ ,$$\n",
    "where $\\Delta$ denotes a \"coherent\" part of the noise and $\\Lambda$, as previously, is some stochastic, invertible map. \n",
    "\n",
    "In such a case, we can relate probability vector obtained on the noisy detector to ideal one in manner similar as before\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{p_{exp}} = \\Lambda \\mathbf{p_{ideal}} + \\mathbf{d}\\ , $$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{d}$ denotes a disturbance of probability vector due to existence of coherent part of the noise.\n",
    "If we now multiply the above expression by inverse of the noise matrix, we obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{p_{exp}} = \\mathbf{p_{ideal}} + \\Lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{d}, \\  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: finish\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to choose decomposition?\n",
    "In general, we can always perform decomposition into \"classical\" and \"coherent\" part in infinitely many ways. However, for the ideal detector $P$ modeled as projective measurement in computational basis, there exists a perfectly natural ansatz. Namely, we propose to consider diagonal parts of POVM's $\\mathbf{M}$ elements to describe classical part of the noise. \n",
    "As a justification for such choice, note that elements of $\\mathbf{P}$ for such ideal detector model are diagonal, and the stochastic map would preserve the diagonality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, after obtaining description of POVM $\\mathbf{M}$ from detector tomography, reconstruction of $\\Lambda$ can be achieved by taking only diagonal parts of POVM's elements.\n",
