    "In this section description of proposed method will be provided. There are several important things to note first. Our method is targeted at such error model wherein dominant noise is classical. In practice, alongiside classical noise, there also exists coherent noise. Information about both of these noises can be, in a way, extracted from QDT. The usage of QDT module has been extracted in previous section.\n",
