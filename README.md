# QREM
QREM - Quantum Readout Errors Mitigation, an open-source package for implementing techniques of measurement error mitigation on quantum devices.

## Code Style
We use PEP8 as a code style for this project.

According to PEP8 style guide all function and variable names should be in lower case. In mathematics matrices
are usually named using capital letters, for better distinction. In order for both of these obligations to be satisfied
we will use prefix _m__, to mark all matrices.
